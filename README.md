# Prompt - Ruby

## Conditionals

### Objectives

1. Learn about conditionals in Ruby.

### Instructions

Research and then write answers to the following questions in **lib/conditionals.md**.

- What is a conditional?
- What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

Remember two things:

1. You don't need to submit any code to us for this assignment. Just provide in-your-own-words answers for the questions above.
2. We're not looking for any kind of advanced writing skills nor any kind of length. Just be clear and thoughtful about what you write--organize it however it makes sense for you.

### Resources

As always, one resource is Google. Some of the questions above can by entered verbatim into a Google search, and for others that won't be as effective. Either way, expect to read (or watch videos) about more than just the simple answer to each question. Often a question's answer--even one that seems short or simple--doesn't really make sense until after you've read the paragraphs before and after it.
